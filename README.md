# alphago-zero
This is a project of [Reinforcement Learning KR group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ReinforcementLearningKR/).

### Project objective
AlphaZero is Reinforcement Learning algorithm which is effectively 
combine MCTS(Monte-Carlo Tree Search) with Actor-Critic. Our objective is learning AlphaGo Zero and
applying to another domain problem.  

There are 4 little objectives to achieve  
1. MCTS on Tic-Tac-Toe
2. AlphaZero on Omok
3. AlphaGo Zero on Go of OpenAI gym
4. upload AlphaGo Zero on web
